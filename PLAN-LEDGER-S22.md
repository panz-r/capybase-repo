# PLAN-LEDGER — Sprint 22 (living document, update as work proceeds)

Purpose: same durable-record discipline as prior ledgers. **Read this
first on resume.** All work on `dev`; never push (user's job).

## Context

Sprint-22 is the sharded harvest sprint: run each language shard,
analyze failures, implement improvements, launch the next shard with
the improvements. Shard 1 (Python) landed 88.3% (+3.6pp vs harvest).
Three external reviews of the failure report were collected; this
ledger records the synthesized improvement plan.

## Reviewer rating (recorded per the user's request)

**Reviewer 1 — most useful.** The provenance-aware resurrection guard
(check parent final states, not just "any reappeared content") is the
single best idea across all three: it's MORE precise, not a
relaxation — exactly capybase's philosophy. The insertion-within-
deletion salvage rule for flask-0006 is the correct deterministic
approach. Weak point: the "repair-by-example" line-substitution
mechanism risks subtle context mismatches.

**Reviewer 2 — strong on porting, but contains one dangerous
suggestion.** The AST skeleton intent override (accept PASS when
jaccard < 0.85 but skeleton match > 0.90) directly violates the
pre-registered decision: "skeleton-hash eval-only — never overrides
the compiler or production gates" (template §E, sprint-20). This is
metric gaming and is REJECTED. The whole-side compile probe for
Python is a good port of existing C++ machinery. The micro-CEGIS
suggestion is already implemented (S20.6).

**Reviewer 3 — best prioritization discipline.** The "what I would
NOT do" section is the most valuable: explicitly rejecting guard
weakening, global retry increases, and more few-shot examples. The
pre-resolution deletion context injection (prompt-level, no guard
change) is the safest approach to Class A. Decision-point
decomposition is interesting but too ambitious for this sprint.

## Standing constraints (carried forward)

- Compiler is authority; no silent wrong merge
- Skeleton-hash: eval-only, never a gate
- No partial-buffer compilation backtracking
- No heavy parser (clangd/rust-analyzer/tree-sitter)
- Conservative-by-construction escalation

## Improvement plan (from reviewer synthesis)

| # | Item | Source | Target | Effort | Status |
|---|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| P1 | SAFE_SKIP filter for no-conflict cases | all (R1#7, R2#5, R3) | zenodo-0010/0038 | 30m | TODO |
| P2 | Adaptive retry relaxation (high-sim + 1 failing unit) | R1#6, R2#4, R3#1 | zenodo-0012 | 1h | TODO |
| P3 | Asymmetric rewrite fast path (compile-optional) | R1#3, R2#2, R3#C3 | zenodo-0044 | 2h | TODO |
| P4 | Insertion-within-deletion salvage rule | R1#2, R2 (implicit), R3#5 | flask-0006 | 3h | TODO |
| P5 | Provenance-aware resurrection guard | R1#1 (best idea) | zenodo-0063/0064 | 3h | TODO |
| P6 | Pre-resolution deletion context injection | R3#2 | Class A prevention | 3h | TODO |
| P7 | Journal archaeology: 0085's stubborn unit | R3#7 | zenodo-0085 | 2h | TODO |

### Explicitly rejected (with reasons)

- **AST skeleton intent override (R2#3)**: violates pre-registration;
  metric gaming; the eval-only constraint exists precisely to prevent
  "semantic correctness" from overriding the compiler
- **Decision-point decomposition (R3#C1)**: too ambitious for this
  sprint; partially overlaps the rejected incremental-splice
  architecture; defer to sprint-23 with calibration data
- **Repair-by-example line substitution (R1#4)**: substitution risks
  context mismatches the compiler can't catch (semantic drift);
  golden-path examples are for the model to learn from, not for
  automated copy-paste into outputs
- **Increasing few-shot examples for mid-band (R1#4b)**: R3's
  analysis is correct — the failure is decision-point ambiguity, not
  "what a merge looks like"; more examples won't fix it
